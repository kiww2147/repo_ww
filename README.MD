#Multi-threaded keyword search
This program scans a given set of URLs and determines whether a specific keyword exists on each page

## Usage
The executable jar can be run by passing two parameters: <br />
1)The input file containing URLs (a CSV file with the naked domain in the 2nd field) and <br />
2)The keyword to search for

e.g.
<i>java -jar out/artifacts/websearch_jar/websearch.jar urls.txt free</i>
